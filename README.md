# Welcome to my React Drum Machine!

## This is part of the frontend project for my certificate on [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

this is a simple project you only need to clone the project
cd the folder
after that npm install
and then npm run dev and you should see the project running

I have to admit something this project 3 years ago was so intimidating that i didn't even try to make this, it was so complex that I used to see it as i will be only to do it after a long time, long story short today i wanted to make it and I did it in like 2 hours at much!!!!!!!

Its crazy for me to think that this impossible project I was able to do it in 2 hour and in a clean way, for all those that are in this journey I can only say never stop learning and special thanks for freecodecamp without them i could never get so far and for all of the internet, thanks for all. this is really a special project/moment for me <3

take care!
